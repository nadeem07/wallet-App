extract or clone the wallet-App repository
to run backend node js , first make changes to routes file
--> on top while importing database add username,password,port and database  eg- var db = pgp('postgres://{username}:{password}@localhost:{port}/{database}')
open the terminal  inside the wallet-app folder and run --> "npm install" command which will download the packages required. 
after install in complete . run node index.js to run the node server

same way now go inside wallet-frontend folder open terminal and run the command --> "npm install" which will download the modules used.
after install is complete type the command --> "npm start" to run the app on browser.

thanks
