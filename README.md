extract or clone the wallet-App repository to run backend node js , first make changes to routes file	                                                                                                                        
--> on top while importing database add username,password,port and database  								                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     	
eg- var db = pgp('postgres://{username}:{password}@localhost:{port}/{database}')                                                                                        	
open the terminal  inside the wallet-app folder                                                                                                                                      
and run --> "npm install" command which will download the packages required.                                                                                                           	 
after install in complete . run node index.js to run the node server                                                                                                             	

same way now go inside wallet-frontend folder open terminal                                                                                                                           	
and run the command --> "npm install" which will download the modules used .                                                                                                        	
after install is complete type the command --> "npm start" to run the app on browser.
